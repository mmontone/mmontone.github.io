## Favourite programming languages

**Smalltalk** and **Lisp** (*Common Lisp*) are my favourite programming languages. Apart from them, there are not many programming languages with:

* A **robust theoretical core.** Smalltalk, syntax in a t-shirt. Lisp, maxwell equations. Both designed quite a long time ago, by some [bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) [minds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_P._Gabriel).
* **Uniformity.** In Smalltalk, there are classes and objects, and message passing; and that uniformity is reflected in the syntax too. In Lisp, code is data, and data is code, and everything looks like a list.
* **Interactive development.** Both languages are image based. The image provides access to the running application, and there are no separate compile/run/debug phases. Both Smalltalk and Lisp provide the tools for live exploration, inspection, debugging, and much more.
* **Development of DSLs.** Lisp is the best suited for this, as it provides macros. Smalltalk flexible syntax is good enough for developing embedded DSLs.
