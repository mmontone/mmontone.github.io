## Favourite programming languages

Smalltalk and Lisp (Common Lisp) are my favourite programming languages. Apart from them, there are not many programming languages with:

* A robust theoretical core. Smalltalk, syntax in a t-shirt. Lisp, maxwell equations.
* Uniformity. In Smalltalk, there are classes and objects, and message passing; and that uniformity is reflected in the syntax too. In Lisp, code is data, and data is code, and everything looks like a list.
* Interactive development. Both languages are image based. The image provides access to the running application, and there are no separate compile/run/debug phases. Both Smalltalk and Lisp provide the tools for live exploration, inspection, debugging, and much more.
* Development of DSLs. Lisp is the best suited for this, as it provides macros. Smalltalk flexible syntax is good enough for developing embedded DSLs.
