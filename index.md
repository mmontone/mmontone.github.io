## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="face.png">

Hi! I'm a software developer from Argentina.

I'm interested in software development and programming languages, and specialize in [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) and [language oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-oriented_programming). I believe in creating abstractions and languages close to the problem domain, so that the mapping between requirements and implementation is as direct as possible. My projects and libraries involve the development of [DSLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) in one way or another, and I'm diving into [Domain Specific Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_modeling) too.

## Open source libraries and projects

I've developed several Open Source libraries, most of them in Smalltalk and Common Lisp, my [favourite programming languages](/favourite). They are all available on my [Github](https://github.com/mmontone) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/mmontone) accounts.

Here is a short list of the most relevant:

* [Common-Lisp.net](http://common-lisp.net) redesign (2018).
* [Djula](https://github.com/mmontone/djula). Djula is a port of Python's Django template engine to Common Lisp.
* [Erudite](https://github.com/mmontone/erudite). A Literate Programming system for Common Lisp. Also, a [Smalltalk equivalent](https://bitbucket.org/mmontone/cuis-smalltalk-erudite).
* Several other libraries for Common Lisp: [a web router](https://github.com/mmontone/easy-routes), [a web forms handler](https://github.com/mmontone/cl-forms), [a library for implementing REST web APIs](https://github.com/mmontone/rest-server), [a generic validation library](https://github.com/mmontone/clavier), and [more](https://github.com/mmontone?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=common+lisp). 
* Experimental projects on [DSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_modeling):
   - [GML](https://bitbucket.org/mmontone/gml). Generic Modeling Language. A readable language to describe models. Similar to [HUTN](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/hutn/).
   - [Mold](https://bitbucket.org/mmontone/mold). A Domain Modeling Environment. My current attempt at synthesizing my ideas about languages and modeling, in a live environment on top of Smalltalk. *This is very much work in progress and not ready for public consumption*.

See the full list [here](/software). 
I'm also building a [list of interesting things](/links) I find about software development and its future.
