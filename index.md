## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="face.png">

Hi! I'm a software developer from Argentina.

I'm interested in programming languages. I believe in [language oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-oriented_programming), that is, 
> creating an implementation language as isomorphic as possible to the user's descriptions, so that the mapping between requirements and implementation is as direct as possible.

So, I develop (DSLs)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language] and I'm diving into (Domain Specific Modeling)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_modeling] too.

## Open source libraries and projects

I've developed several Open Source libraries, most of them in Smalltalk and Common Lisp, my [favourite programming languages](/favouriteProgrammingLanguages).

Here I list the most relevant:

* [Common-Lisp.net](http://common-lisp.net) redesign (2018).
* [Djula](https://github.com/mmontone/djula). Djula is a port of Python's Django template engine to Common Lisp.
* [Erudite](https://github.com/mmontone/erudite). A Literate Programming system for Common Lisp. Also, a [Smalltalk equivalent](https://bitbucket.org/mmontone/cuis-smalltalk-erudite).
