## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="face.png">

Hi! I'm a software developer from Argentina.

I'm interested in programming languages. I believe in [language oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-oriented_programming), that is, 
> creating an implementation language as isomorphic as possible to the user's descriptions, so that the mapping between requirements and implementation is as direct as possible.

So, I develop [DSLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) and I'm diving into [Domain Specific Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_modeling) too.

## Open source libraries and projects

I've developed several Open Source libraries, most of them in Smalltalk and Common Lisp, my [favourite programming languages](/favourite). It's all available on my [Github](https://github.com/mmontone) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/mmontone) accounts.

Here I list the most relevant:

* [Common-Lisp.net](http://common-lisp.net) redesign (2018).
* [Djula](https://github.com/mmontone/djula). Djula is a port of Python's Django template engine to Common Lisp.
* [Erudite](https://github.com/mmontone/erudite). A Literate Programming system for Common Lisp. Also, a [Smalltalk equivalent](https://bitbucket.org/mmontone/cuis-smalltalk-erudite).
* Experimental projects on [DSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_modeling):
   - [GML](https://bitbucket.org/mmontone/gml). Generic Modeling Language. A readable language to describe models. Similar to [HUTN](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/hutn/).
   - [Mold](https://bitbucket.org/mmontone/mold). A Domain Modeling Environment. My current attempt at synthesizing my ideas about languages and modeling, in a live environment on top of Smalltalk. *This is very much work in progress and not ready for public consumption*.

See the full list [here](/software). I'm also building a [list of interesting things](/links) I find about software development and its future.
